# Game Guidelines:
* See Instruction Tab for details

In this game, you will be making some choices to earn as many coins as possible. You will play with another person in real time. Your decision, together with the other person's decision, will determine how many coins each of you earn by the end of the game.

The more coins you earn, the more REAL money you will receive!

In each round, you will see 2 cards: a RED card, and a BLUE card.

You and the other person will be asked to pick one of the cards. You won't know what each other picked until the end of each round. In this game, 4 things can happen:

1. If you both picked the RED card, you will both get 1 coin.

2. If you picked the RED card, and the other person picked the BLUE card, you will get 0 coins, and the other person will get 2 coins.

3. If you picked the BLUE card, and the other person picked the RED card, you will get 2 coins, and the other person will get 0 coins.

4. If you both picked the BLUE card, you will both get 0 coins.

We will show you how many coins you and the other person earned after each round.

When you are ready, please click the "Practice Rounds" tab on the top. Once you are done with practicing, move on to the "Game Rounds" to start playing! Good luck!

# Important Notes

The child is not actually playing with a person, but the goal is to make the child believe they are. 

The computer is set to ALWAYS choose the blue card to pose as a cooperative player in this game. There could be another version of this game where the computer always chooses the red card to pose as a very competitive player.
